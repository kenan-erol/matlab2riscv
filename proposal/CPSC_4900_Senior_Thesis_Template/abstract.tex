The abstract is a brief description of the paper. Write it in 100-150 words in general. For the thesis, it can be longer. Present your research questions, your contribution to the computer science literature, a concise description of your work, and how you answered your research question. Add a statement of the main results. 
This part can be revisited when the paper is complete.

Then, you can revisit the title of the paper. If you are revisiting the title of your paper, ask this question: Which one best explains the main point of the paper? 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Microfinance
    \item Microfinance and Economic Development
    \item Microfinance as a Strategy for Economic Development: Realizing its Potential for Improving the Standing of Women
\end{itemize}

Now, examine your title. Does it show the main point of the paper? If you wanted to rewrite it, how would you do it?
