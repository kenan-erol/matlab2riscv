A good conclusion leaves readers with a clear statement of your point and a renewed appreciation of its significance. 

Start with a brief statement of your research questions. Describe the main results. Provide a summary of the conclusion. Emphasize the contribution of your work. 

A title is the first thing readers read and the last thing you should write. It is not just a few words to suggest the topic of your papers. A title is useful when it helps readers understand specifically what is to come.  Put into your title the keywords in your main point.
